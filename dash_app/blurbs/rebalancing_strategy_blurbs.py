logistics_blurb = '''Citibike has live data on bike availability at every station in their dock network and therefore knows which stations need to be rebalanced in real time. However, moving all of these bikes throughout the day requires sufficient resources and planning.  To help solve this logistics problem, we have created a tool that can be used by Citibike to plan ahead and have employees located at stations with a predicted high bike availability to move them to docks with a bike deficit.
'''

ml_blurb = '''We have created a Random Forest Regressor Machine Learning model to predict the bike availability at each station. The ML model was trained on bike availability data for the last full year of data collected. Features in the model include the day and time, latitude and longitude coordinates, weather data, and the number of docks for each station.'''

algorithm_blurb = '''The user will input a day and time in the next 48-hour window. The model then makes a prediction on the bike availability for every station. The user inputs 5 filters: low availability threshold, high availability threshold, maximum distance, minimum cargo size, and maximum total bikes rebalanced. The low and high availability stations based on the proportion of available bikes are identified. The deficit and surplus bike counts needed to reach a healthy proportion are calculated for each of these stations. Stations with high availability are matched with ones with low availability based on their surplus and deficit bike counts under the constraints of maximum distance, minimum cargo size, and maximum total bikes rebalanced. The results are then output to a table as well as a map for visualization purposes.'''
