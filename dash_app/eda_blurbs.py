rollout_clusters_blurb = '''Based on CitiBike’s expansion plan there were 3 official dock rollout phases. For visualization purposes we grouped the rollouts by the year each station first appeared in the data. The figure to the left shows 8 rollout clusters (each year from 2013-2019). We can see that the first stations were placed in Midtown Manhattan, Downtown Manhattan, and Downtown Brooklyn. The next phase continued to Uptown Manhattan, continued to disperse around Downtown Brooklyn, and the first Queens stations were installed in Long Island City. From there, Manhattan docks continued to expand further uptown to Harlem and the Brooklyn and Queens docks continued to expand further away from Downtown Brooklyn and Long Island City. The final cluster expanded into the Bronx and continued the geographic spread of Brooklyn and Queens.

Based on the expansion stages observed, we suspect that the strategy for rollout was to prioritize the central business districts of Downtown Manhattan, Midtown Manhattan, Downtown Brooklyn and Long Island City, and then expand outward keeping a continuous network of docks at all times. '''

pop_density_blurb = '''To better understand CitiBikes choice of choosing where to start, we investigated the Population Density of NYC. This information was taken from the New York Master Plan from 2021 available on NYC Open Data. We assumed the population density stayed relatively consistent over the time period from 2013-2021. From the map, we see that downtown Manhattan is quite populated, and so is downtown Brooklyn. '''

transit_location_blurb = ''' Based on the motivation of bikeshare to solve the ‘last mile’ of transportation, we suspected when locating docks on a more granular level they would prioritize locating docks in the vicinity of public transit hubs. The figure on the left shows dock locations plotted with subway stations and bus stops. We can see in almost all cases that there is a dock within 1 block of each subway station and bus stop. '''

usage_plot_blurb = '''To better understand the usage patterns of Citi Bike customers, we analyzed the number of rides per day and per hour. We note that during the weekdays, the most popular times were during the morning and afternoon rush hours. We see very different usage patterns for the weekends, where most rides occur during mid day.'''

ride_per_minute_blurb = '''This histogram displays the distribution of ride duration to the nearest minute. The plot displays the number of rides that lasted an approximate number of minutes. The peak of this distribution is at a ride duration of 6 minutes. The majority of rides last less than 15 minutes, likely used for commuting purposes.'''

rides_per_month_blurb = '''The plot on the left shows the monthly total number of rides every year. There’s a clear upward trend of total rides per year as well as a seasonal trend. The usership of Citibike plummeted when Covid-19 broke out, but the number of rides went back to normal levels after the city started to reopen businesses.'''
