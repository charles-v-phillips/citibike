Purpose:
To determin the maximum downtime for each bike. We hoped to bea ble to tell whether or not a bike was being repaired/refurbished

Query:

SELECT bike_id, MAX(time_btw_rides) as max_lag from

(SELECT bike_id, started_at, 
cast(started_at as datetime) - lag(cast(started_at as datetime),1)
over (partition by bike_id order by started_at) as time_btw_rides
FROM `citi-bike-333915.citi_bike_data.old` ORDER BY bike_id, started_at)

GROUP BY bike_id
ORDER BY max_lag
